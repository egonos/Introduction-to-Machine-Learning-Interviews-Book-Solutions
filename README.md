# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning-Interviews-Book-Solutions

In this work, I aim to share the knowledge I've accumulated in the field of machine learning. In addition to providing answers, you'll find plenty of illustrations to clarify concepts. Where I've found myself unable to answer a question, I've cited references that I've used to answer. I've also included recommendations based on my own experiences in data science. I hope you will find this repository useful.

Main resources I have utilized:

My notes from my previous research: Most of my answers are coming from there.
