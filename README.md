# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning-Interviews-Book-Solutions

In this work, I aim to share the knowledge I've accumulated in the field of machine learning. In addition to providing answers, you'll find a plently of illustrations to clarify concepts. Where I've found myself unable to answer a question, I've cited references that I've used to answer. I've also included recommendations based on my own experiences in data science. I hope you will find this respriatory useful.
